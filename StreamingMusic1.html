        <li>Definition of streaming music <br>
          Streaming is a technology used to deliver content to computers and mobile devices over the internet.
          The difference between Download and Streaming is, that the data that you download is permanently stored on your device. As
          opposed to that, the data you stream is automatically deleted and you don't have to wait for it to be completely downloaded
          before you using it.
