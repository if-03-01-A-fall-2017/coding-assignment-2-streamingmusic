      <h1>How streaming music services work</h1>
      <p>Most Internet music players work in a similar way: the user picks a musician or a song and then site begings streaming the song's data to your device.</p>
      <p>Here we will explain you the technology behind popular streaming music services like <a href="www.spotify-com">Spotify</a>.</p>

      <p>Services like Spotify and Soundcloud relie on a peer-to-peer <strong>(P2P)</strong> network.</p>
      <p>When the user selects a song, Spotify's computers immediately begin sending the data to your computer.
         At the same time, it looks for other Spotify users who have the song on their computers.
       When it finds the track, it sends bits of the song to your computer.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Another trick these streaming music services use is caching (storing) the songs the user listens right on their hard drive.
       That means, that their computer plays the song. The size of the cache is set by default to <strong>10 GB</strong>, but users can adjust its size.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Spotify is very smart. The site knows that most of its users listen to albums from beginning to end, so if you start playing the first song of an album,
          Spotify beings preloading subsequent tracks, too, so that you never experience playback delays.</p>
